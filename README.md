# AWSomeGame
Is a collection of mini-games developed by me as I learn React, Next.js, and possibly migrate JavaScript to TypeScript. At the moment, there are two games available: Tic tac toe, and Memotest.

The project uses Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, and its user interface is based on the classic Gameboy design with some updated details. I created the Gameboy cartridge images myself, although the illustration for each game was created using Midjourney.

## Available Games
### Tic Tac Toe
The classic game of Tic Tac Toe. Play against a friend or the computer and try to get three in a row!

### Memotest
Challenge your memory with this classic game of matching pairs. Flip over the cards and try to find all the matching pairs.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository
Install the dependencies using npm install
Run the development server using npm run dev

## Feedback
I welcome any feedback and suggestions for improving the code or the games themselves. Feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you notice anything that can be improved.
